# Codelabs_Vision_SEF
Codelabs ML Kit Vision test.

This project was made only to experiment with the ML Kit Vision library and most of the code 
was copied from the Codelabs shared project. Some minor changes include replacing some "for"
loops into their forEach counterparts, and turning annonymous class definitions into
lambdas.
